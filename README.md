# Iris-flower-classification

ðŸ“Œ Predict the different species of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ·

Dataset Information:

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
Attribute Information:-

1.sepal length in cm

2.sepal width in cm

3.petal length in cm

4.petal width in cm

5.species

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolour

Iris Virginica

Next, I split the dataset into training and testing sets, with 70% for training and 30% for testing. I trained several classification models, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees. I evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy as the metric.

The best performing model was the logistic regression, which achieved an
accuracy of 100% on the testing set. This means that the model was able to correctly predict the species of an iris flower 100% of the time.
